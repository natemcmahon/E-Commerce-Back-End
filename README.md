# E-Commerce-Backend

## Description
    
The E-Commerce-Backend is a backend setup for a retail inventory database. It is seeded by MySQL with products and their corresponding tags and product categories. We are able to query this inventory based on user requests to see products based on category, tags or search based on primary keys. The user is able to create new products, tags, categories and do other actions as well as our other HTTP request types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The products, tags and categories are defined in their respective models
